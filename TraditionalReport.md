# Project Objectives

# Project Design
Our team goal is to create a functional calendar with features such as setting up events and reminders, a built-in study timer and tips, and saving events onto the local workstation.

# Implementation
This project uses Python 3.10 with the tkinter and tkcalendar libraries that power the core graphical user interface and features. We also utilized Pylint to check for coding errors.     
### Challenges and Solutions
  - Having issues with certain features using Calendar module
    - Dropped the feature or found another way
    - UI would not scale properly when resized but eventually figured it out
    - Ex: Couldn’t add multiple event colors on calendar, so we left the days with events having one color
  - Pylint errors were a major problem, and we had to re-edit the code to fix said errors
    - A fix for this was that we disabled a couple of the errors
  - Difficulty ensuring all Buttons Fit
    - Buttons would overlap each other
    - Including “padx” and “pady”
